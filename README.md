# SeaTek
 A game made in 7 days for an itch.io game jam

- The game has 5 levels in the menu but I was only able to comlete 2 in the time frame.
- I did not get to add music
- I never was able to add instructions on how to play so here they are.

	- The goal is to recovery treasure for your company, SeaTek. You want the lowest score possible 
	at the end of the game. You should find the escape pod in the level as fast as you can but treasure you find will 
	greatly reduce your final score. Coins are worth 1 point and chest are worth 5.
